# Gir
Combining Oh Shit, Git!?! and Gum

## What is this?
With the elements of [Gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) and [Oh Shit, Git!?!](https://ohshitgit.com/), I made an attempt at making a simple shell script that can combine the two together.

There's not much else to say.......except that the Setup...at least works

To install, grab the latest Setup.sh from [the latest release](https://github.com/Icycoide/Gir/releases/latest) and run it
